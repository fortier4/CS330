I uploaded the cpp source code file instead of the zipped project folder because the zipped project folder was to large to upload.

	A new skill that I learned as an approach to designing software is how to render 3D objects and a complete 3D scene on screen.  The design process that I followed to complete my work was to start with a plan, then write the code that followed along with said plan, and finally fix any bugs that were present in the initial code.  Tactics from the design approach I used could be applied out in industry as they the process I used is very applicable to many different projects.  A new development strategy that I used to work on the 3D scene was how to apply a coordinate system to a computer program.  Iteration factored into my development process by creating many revisions of the project, one after the other, until the desired result had been achieved by the final deliverable.  The approach that I used to develop code throughout the milestones changed from the beginning of the course by showing a deeper understanding of computational graphics and visualizations at the end of the course as compared to the beginning.  Furthermore, the knowledge gained from this course could be applied to my future educational pathway by now having a strong foundation and understanding of computational graphics and visualizations.  Lastly, the skills gained from this course could be applied out in industry if I ever were to get a job that benefits from an understanding of computational graphics and visualizations such as a video game developer.
